# Udacity Project - Corporate Dashboard

Develop a corporate dashboard application using a front-end MVC framework of your choosing. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboardâ€™s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area.

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
- `node ws-server.js` Starts a mock server pushing updates through WebSocket after 10s.
